### Features, Abstractions, Implementations, Vernacular & Such That Need to be Researched and Thought Upon
**Unreadable in Markdown; Markdown file is only used for personal syntax coloring, that is already built for markdown, and I won't be rebuilding it, I'm kinda lazy**
**Remove what isn't needed or going to be implemented**
**Reorder to highest to lowest priority**
**There will be copies, I'd rather have copies, than miss something, but try to remember to 'Find' duplicates**

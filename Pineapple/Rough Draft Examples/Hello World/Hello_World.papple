~ This is a preprocessor statement
Import{
    Standard
}

~ The recommended way to write out any functional statements in Pineapple is as a code block
PrintLine()
{
    "Hello, World!";
}

~ Can also be written as one line though if one chooses. The compiler will get rid of all white-space during compilation
PrintLine(){"Hello, World!";}

### Toran
A suite of completely free-to-use applications for developers. Under heavy development. don't expect anything to work yet.

The goal of Toran is to provide a completely, truly free, and competent set of tools for anyone to use.

Optionally comes in VM form to run underneath host OS.

### Pineapple
Pineapple is a programming language.

### Iwa
Iwa is the official compiler for Pineapple, and will be capable of transplicing, and recompling other languages into Pineapple, or Pineapple into other languages.

### Lily
Lily is the official interpreter for Pineapple.

### Peach
Peach is the parser written in Python to generate Intermediate Data Files from Pineapple source code.

### Hope
The build system for Pineapple.

### HPM (Hope Package Manager)
The package manager built into Hope. Inspired by Cargo from Rust, and Pip from Python.

### Pim
A terminal-based text editor written in Python.

### Toran's Syntax Highlighting Theme
A custom theme explained in standardized form, that can be easily supported whereever may be needed.

### ExoFyle
A minimal lightweight code editor, comes packaged with Pineapple.

### ExoFyle IDE
A complete integreated development environment to support Pineapple development.

### Cornelius
Toran's Overseer, and personal virtual assistant. Explicitly offline by default. An ever-running entity on top of Toran's runtime, that relies on a pre-generated dataset to assist a Toran user in largely anything. The user can optionally "push data" to Cornelius's master dataset, and optionally 'pull data' from Cornelius's master dataset. Any data pushed to the master dataset is run through heavy parsing, data anonymization, and a complex compilation process, that is then 'inserted' into the CDP (Cornelius Data Processor), where it will be fed into the master dataset carefully, to avoid overtaking, regression, and unsupervised repeated analysis.

Cornelius is the only 'tool' that is indeed a product, is not open-source, and largely does not come packaged with Toran. Cornelius is downloaded onto your system as a pre-compiled, obfuscated code, that you are not intended to access, so please respect that.

### Mel
Audio development environment.

## Cornelius :hammer_and_wrench:
Toran's Overseer, and personal virtual assistant. Explicitly offline by default. An ever-running entity on top of Toran's runtime, that relies on a pre-generated dataset to assist a Toran user in largely anything. The user can optionally "push data" to Cornelius's master dataset, and optionally 'pull data' from Cornelius's master dataset. Any data pushed to the master dataset is run through heavy parsing, data anonymization, and a complex compilation process, that is then 'inserted' into the CDP (Cornelius Data Processor), where it will be fed into the master dataset carefully, to avoid overtaking, regression, and unsupervised repeated analysis.

Cornelius is the only 'tool' that is indeed a product, is not open-source, and largely does not come packaged with Toran. Cornelius is downloaded onto your system as a pre-compiled, obfuscated code, that you are not intended to access, so please respect that.

## Mel :no_entry:
Audio development environment.

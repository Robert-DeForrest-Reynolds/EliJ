Toran is a software suite for computer scientists.
We call it an operating environment, because it provides an isolated environment to develop code. There is not yet a virtual runtime underneath, but that is the ultimate goal, as providing an isolated environment that is even isolated from the native operating system would be gold.

Toran 1.0 can be described as featuring so:
- Pineapple Programming Language Tools
	- Peach - tool for generating Intermediate Data Files
	- Iwa - Compiler, for developing large-scale applications
	- Lily - Interpreter, for rapid-development of applications and data science
	- ExoFyle
	- ExoFyle IDE

# What is an Artificial Intelligence?
A physical machine that has sensors/peripherals for input and output, and is loaded with some kind of computational hardware that provides a concurrent runtime.
# What is Physical Machinery?
The matter of the entity. For a human, it would be our body, including our brain.
# What is Runtime?
The time in which an artificial intelligences computational hardware is running. This can be compared to a human, and them being alive, while a human is alive, their brain's runtime alive.
# What is a Thought?
A thought is structuring of data, that can be then loaded into short-memory or saved for long-term memory.
# What is Short Term Memory?
Memory that is loaded within the Runtime of computational hardware.
# What is Long Term Memory?
Memory that is saved within the physical machinery, and can be reloaded into the runtime utilizing conduits.

# What is a Node?
A collection of data to be interacted with by the Runtime.

Node-based design patterns when designing artificial intelligences seem to be the safest best in approaching complex intelligence.

A node has properties of which can be utilized for behavior.

Each node has it's own memory, of all of it's previous states. This is a dictionary, the keys being the "Memory Stamp", and the value being another dictionary formatted, with the keys being the property names, and the values being the previous values of the properties.

Node types:
- Text
- Image
- Video
- Audio

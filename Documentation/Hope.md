[[Projects]]

### Utilized Technology (possibly embedded into project)

- GCC
- Clang
- MinGW
- Python
- MicroPython
- When hope is called, we need to analyze the commands that are given.
- Then we will execute functions depending on what commands were given.
    - Project Creation
    - Project Prototyping
        Make it easy as can be to do rapid prototyping with a compiled language
        Compiles to a temporary folder containing executable, that is then run, deletes temporary folder upon closing executable
    - Project Building
    - Project Build & Run
    - Project Cleaning
    - Project Debugging
    - Project Version Control System Management
    - Project Removal
    - Project Recycling Bin
- We’ll generate a custom file for project settings, and whatnot, which also means we’ll have to do some custom parsing of that file.
- We’ll generate a .gitignore file, regardless of if a git repository is initialized or not, to ensure private files are not leaked, there will be an optional command when generating your project to stop this, but it will stay default for what I think are obvious reasons
- I’ll need to plan for implementing a package manager that accesses a website to upload, and download packages.

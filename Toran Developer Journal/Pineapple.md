Simple Standardization of the Vernacular, Abstractions, and Expected Output from Input; Complex, Diverse, & Distinct Implementation

Others will be able to easily build custom compilers, or alike technology due to the incredibly simple, and concise codified standard.

Pineapple will optionally have a secure runtime environment for execution. I will implement a strategy that involves the ideas of "ownership", "borrowing", "loaning", and "priveleges". Implementing a form of "promises" may be viable as well.
Built-in error handling is important.
As few stacks will be used as possible, as fast as possible, with security in mind.

I think writing a seperate standard for each implementation of Pineapple would be healthier than explaining in a singular unified documentation, that would be expected to conform to different patterns and paradigms. Iwa, Pineapple's official compiler that recompiles the code to assembly, will be written seperately to for example PappleScript, which will be the official compiler that recompiles Pineapple code to Javascript. As systems programming, and web development have vastly different abstractions, and implementation strategies.

I will support different "targeted architectures", as in systems (assembly, targeted micro-processors, etc.), HTTPS/HTML/JavaScript, etc.

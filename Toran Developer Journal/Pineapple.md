Simple Standardization of the Vernacular, Abstractions, and Output from Input; Complex & Diverse Implementation

Others will be able to easily build custom compilers, or alike technology due to the incredibly simple, and concise codified standard.

### Feature List

 - Ability to launch executable or uncompiled script in an "Interactive Mode"
 - Compilation Targets
 - Built-in Package Manager
 - Built-in Build System
 - Built-in Documentation
 

**Standard Library**
 - Input/Output
 - File Management
 - Primitive Graphic Rendering
 - Math

Pineapple will use a secure runtime environment for execution. I will implement a strategy that involves the ideas of "ownership", "borrowing", "loaning", and "priveleges". Implementing a form of "promises" may be viable as well.
Built-in error handling is important.
As few stacks will be used as possible, as fast as possible, with security in mind.

I think writing a seperate standard for each implementation of Pineapple would be healthier than explaining in a singular unified documentation. Iwa, Pineapple's official compiler that recompiles the code to assembly, will be written seperately to for example PappleScript, which will be the official compiler that recompiles Pineapple code to Javascript.

I will support different "targeted architectures", as in systems (assembly, targeted micro-processors, etc.), HTTPS/HTML/JavaScript

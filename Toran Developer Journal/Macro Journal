I want to build a very performant OS-like "platform", Toran. On this platform will be a multitude of different pre-built applications providing tools in different fields. A programming language and scripting language will be avaiable for use within the platform without need of any external tools.

"An running OS-like application atop a running host OS, that is capable enough that you could write another OS-like application written and running in it."
Kernels for days kids.

I want Toran to be able to run on anything literally. That means as a desktop application, or within the web browser. On mobile, or even small low level hardware devices.
I want Toran to be interpretable for sanity sake, but compilable, and executable anywhere as to be downloaded onto an external USB or sort to run anywhere, anytime, on anything.

Eventually Toran may hopefully be built into a bootloadable operating system written completely in Pineapple.

A rapid prototype could be built, but I'll have to research a bit more to find out which language would be suitable.
In the meantime, I need to work on Pineapple more.
Maybe practice programming by writing a CLI text editor, maybe even a CLI IDE to come pre-installed with Toran.
